    <section class="section-fixed-nav">
        <div>
            <p>The nav above has <code>position: fixed</code> and <code>top: 0</code>. This means that it remains on the
                screen even as the user scrolls downwards. We also set a background color for the nav. This ensures that
                we can't see other content as it scrolls through the nav.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="css-section-center">
            <p>This paragraph is inside a <code>div</code>. The <code>div</code> is inside a <code>section</code> which
                in turn is nested inside the
                <code>body</code>.
                The <code>div</code> has the following CSS:
            </p>


            <code class="block">
<span class="comment">// the div inside the section</span><br>
margin: auto;   <span class="comment">// center the div horizontally</span>
width: 80vw;    <span class="comment">// the div's width is 80% of the view width</span>    
height: 100vh;  <span class="comment">// the div is 100% of the view height</span></code>
            <p>Note that because the <code>nav</code> has a height of 5rem and the <b>div</b> inside the section has a
                height of 100vh, the total height of our page is 100vh + 5rem, and so we have a vertical scrollbar on
                the right. The section has no height set, and so it will stretch to whatever height is required by the
                div.</p>


            <div class="sticky">This div has <code>position: sticky</code>. Note how it still scrolls off the screen
                once its container scrolls off screen!</div>
        </div>

        <article class="default">
            <p class="percent">This paragraph is inside an <code>article</code>, but it is not inside the <b>div</b>
                that has a width of
                80vw. As a result, the article spans the entire width of the page.</p>
            <p class="percent">The article has <code>font-size: 20rem</code> and this paragraph has a font size of 6%.
                6% of 20 is 1.2,
                and so this paragraph has a font size of <b>1.2rem</b>.</p>
        </article>
        <article class="half-vw">
            <p>This paragraph is in an article with <code>width: 50vw</code></p>
        </article>
        <article class="inline-block">
            <p>This paragraph is in an article with <code>display: inline-block</code>.</p>
        </article>
        <article class="inline">
            <p>This paragraph is in an article with <code>display: inline</code>. Note that no border is displayed even
                though we have <code>border: 1px solid green</code>. This is
                because an inline element will only take up the space required by its content, and so there is no space
                available for a border!</p>
        </article>
        <div>
            <article id="hidden" class="inline-block">
                <p><code>display: inline-block</code></p>

            <p>This red div is positioned relative (<code>position: relative</code>) to its blue article parent.</p>
            <div class="relative-div"></div>
            <p>The red div is positioned over this paragraph. Note the gap between the two paragraphs: the red div is
                treated as if it were at its default position in the html.</p>
        </article>
    </div>
    <div>
        <article class="absolute-article">
            <p>This orange div is positioned absolutely (<code>position: absolute</code>) to the <code>html</code> tag.
            </p>
            <div class="absolute-div"></div>
            <p>The orange div has no non-static ancestor elements, and so to make it appear in its displayed position we
                use <code>top: 250vh</code> and <code>left: 50vw</code></p>
